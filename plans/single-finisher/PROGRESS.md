| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |

| T01 | base-watch | — | ✅ | |
| T02 | finisher-for-single | — | ✅ | |
| T03 | single-end-flow | — | ✅ | |
| T04 | single-helpers-skill | — | ✅ | |
| T05 | single-finisher-wiring | T01, T02, T03, T04 | ✅ | |
| T06 | single-finisher-alerts | T05 | 🔍 | Helper and finisher views in singleNotifyViews; pure singleEndAlerts for hold, red, fallback, finished; 6 tests. Deviations: ROLE already had resolve/fix; singleRunState gains `helper` (T07's sync row may fold it); a resume treats a red wait or fallback it finds as already alerted. |
| T07 | single-finisher-screen | T05 | ⬜ | |
| T08 | single-finisher-drill | T06, T07 | ⬜ | |
| T09 | single-finisher-docs | T05, T06, T07 | ⬜ | |
