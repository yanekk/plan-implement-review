| T06 | single-finisher-alerts | T05 | ⬜ | |
| T07 | single-finisher-screen | T05 | ✅ | Review: no defect. Added a steps-view test for a clash being resolved and a fix helper asking at 60/80/120. Probed held text, red wait, re-sync under the finisher, closed merged check, installed copy. The pty rig does not drive the clash or red-after-fix runs; T08's drill covers them. Recorded deviations accepted. |
