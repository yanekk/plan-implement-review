# Progress

**Update this whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions. What the build taught
lives in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md). Sixty words to a Notes cell, counted.

**Plan reviewed:** 2026-09-29 — 3 fixed, 4 decided with the user

**Status:** Planned, not started. The build waits for `pir/base-branch` to be merged into `main` and
`main` into `pir/single-runs`.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-30
**Next `pir-work` will:** T02 single-flow, the first task on the critical path.

| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | settings-commands | — | ⬜ | |
| T02 | single-flow | — | 🔍 | `singleflow.mjs` and `kind: 'single'`; 64 tests. Deviations: facts gain `head` (with a passed check) and `sessionId`; state gains `pending` and `red`; no `done` step, a finished run keeps its step; `initialSingleState` does not store the prompt; spawn `note` is the raw setup result; a setup note is its own paragraph. Detail in the commit. |
