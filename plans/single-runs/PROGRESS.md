# Progress

**Update this whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions. What the build taught
lives in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md). Sixty words to a Notes cell, counted.

**Plan reviewed:** 2026-09-29 — 3 fixed, 4 decided with the user

**Status:** Planned, not started. The build waits for `pir/base-branch` to be merged into `main` and
`main` into `pir/single-runs`.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-30
**Next `pir-work` will:** T04 single-program, T05 single-launch or T07 single-skill; T01, T02 and T03 are ✅.

| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | settings-commands | — | ✅ | |
| T02 | single-flow | — | ✅ | `singleflow.mjs` and `kind: 'single'`; 66 tests. Review fixed two defects, reproduced by probe and locked by tests: a `dropped` drained with another report or a command result lost to it. Probed a 20 000-run random walk of `decideSingleStep` for invariants: clean after the fix. Implementer's deviations reviewed and kept: facts `head`, `sessionId`; state `pending`, `red`; no `done` step. |
