# Progress

**Update this whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions. What the build taught
lives in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md). Sixty words to a Notes cell, counted.

**Plan reviewed:** 2026-09-29 — 3 fixed, 4 decided with the user

**Status:** Planned, not started. The build waits for `pir/base-branch` to be merged into `main` and
`main` into `pir/single-runs`.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-30
**Next `pir-work` will:** T02 single-flow, the first task on the critical path.

| T10 | single-row | T04, T08 | ✅ | Reviewed: one fix. `→` on a dropped run's review or merge row promised a reviewer and a merge; reproduced on the rig, fixed, test locks it. Probed list widths 60 to 200, a long name's hand-off at 80, a clock going backwards in `mergedCheck`, `single-dropped` on the real screen at both sizes. Deviations accepted: `dropped` argument, `createMergedCheck`, `plan-rig-single-row.test.mjs`, `listColumns`. |
