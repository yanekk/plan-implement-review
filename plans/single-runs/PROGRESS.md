# Progress

**Update this whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions. What the build taught
lives in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md). Sixty words to a Notes cell, counted.

**Plan reviewed:** 2026-09-29 — 3 fixed, 4 decided with the user

**Status:** Planned, not started. The build waits for `pir/base-branch` to be merged into `main` and
`main` into `pir/single-runs`.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-29
**Next `pir-work` will:** T02 single-flow, the first task on the critical path.

| T06 | single-alerts | T04 | ⬜ | |
| T07 | single-skill | T02 | ✅ | |
| T08 | single-rig | T04, T05 | ✅ | Reviewed: no defect, one comment rewrapped. `npm test` green; the 8 tests in `plan-rig-single.test.mjs` run every set through the detached program. Probed: stopping a parked rig run as the teardown does leaves no process or folder; a second run in one rig parks on the taken name (FINDINGS). Screen test asserts the snapshot until T10. `./install.sh` not run. |
