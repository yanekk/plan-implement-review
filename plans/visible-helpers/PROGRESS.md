| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | helper-fold | — | ✅ | |
| T02 | helper-rig-scenario | — | ✅ | |
| T03 | helper-lines | T01, T02 | ✅ | Review clean, no fix commit. Suite green incl. rig e2e 80×24, 120×40. Probed: gate/picker reducers keep the helper name across keys, nested helper and its background command hidden, helper line placed when task_started precedes or follows the Agent call. Deviations accepted: `1 step` singular (person), `statusParts` export, `settleMs: 100`. |
